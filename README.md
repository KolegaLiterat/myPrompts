# ChatGPT prompts list

I decided to make this repo because I need to keep things in one place. Creating multiple notes in Obsidian vault, it is **not** the best solution to every problem.



## Table with used prompts

| Name             | Prompt                                                       | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Players feedback | `I will provide a few batches of players feedback about animations in my game. Summary opinions, divide opinions into negative and positive feedback, also add an importance score for it (range: 1 - 5). After each batch, iterate over the already finished summary. New batch of feedback will start with a word "Batch".` | Works fine with a long feedback from user. Generates nice description, can be adjusted to create bullet points. |
